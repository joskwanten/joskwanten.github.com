        <h2><a href="mog.html">Maze of Galious</a></h2>
        <p>
            I read a lot about web-assembly and was curious if I could just port some existing C++ to web-assembly / javascript by using emscripten. After some testing with emscripten I decided to port something a little more complex. When I was a kid, I used to
            play the Maze of Galious a lot. And in 2003 some guys did a lot of work to make a remake of this game, with nice graphics and music. What I have done is to port this remake version of the Maze of Galious so that you can play it in a browser.
            This is just a very quick and dirty port of the Maze of Galious remake by braingames (
            <a href="http://www.braingames.getput.com/mog/">http://www.braingames.getput.com/mog/</a>). The code is compiled with emscripten to compile C++ code to javascript and the SDL code is tweaked a little bit to make everything work again. Saving
            and loading only works by typing the codes. Storage to disk / local storage is not implemented yet.
